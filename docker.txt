what is Docker?
  Docker is a containerization tool or software which helps to package our application and its required dependencies inside a container.
  by doing this we can run our application across multiple environments without any interruptions.

what is docker image?
  docker image is nothing but a blueprint or snapshot of required OS files, runtime files, metadata files and more in a layered manner.
  which helps to run our application across multiple environments.

what is docker container?
    docker container is a portable and isolated running instance of docker image with our application code and temporary data.

what does docker image contains?
    docker image contains:
    required OS files but not complete OS
    runtime files
    environment variables
    compiler files
    configuration files
    matadata files and more

what does docker container keeps inside it?
    docker container holds:
    docker image as running process
    application code
    temporary storage
    logs and more

example for docker image and container?
    lets take house building as an example:
    before constructing house we will make a blueprint --->  this blueprint refers to docker image
    with the help of blueprint we construct our house to live ---> this constructed object refers to docker container

    think like docker image ---> downloading whatsapp or any application
    docker container means ----> installing that application to use it

we can run multiple containers using single docker image --> just like constructing multiple houses with same blueprint
with the help of container we can share our application to others to run in their instances without installing additional dependencies.
