what is EBS?

EBS (Elastic block store) is a network or physical drive or volume that is attached to ec2 instance or server.
By default some amount of EBS volume will be attached or set-up together with ec2 instance while installing it.

If needed we can add or attach extra EBS or drive volume for an ec2 instance for storage.

EBS volume is scalable. we can increase or decrease the size depending upon the usage.

EBS is provisioned to use in single AZ ( availability zone).

we can not transfer EBS volume to another availability zone neither in same region nor in different region.

single ec2 instance can have multiple EBS volumes attached to it. but an EBS volume can be attached to one ec2 instance at a time.

An EBS volume can be detached from an ec2 instance and can be attched with another ec2 instance within same availability zone.

In-order to attach EBS volume with an ec2 instance in different avaliability zone.
we need to take a snapshot of the EBS volume and with the help of that we can connect to other ec2 instance in different AZ by creating a new EBS volume
and restoring the snapshot within that EBS volume.

EBS volume will be connected to the ec2 instance through wireless network.

EBS volume will use delete on termination attribute which is enabled by default for root EBS volume and disabled for additional or secondary EBS volume.
root EBS is an EBS volume attached to ec2 instance while installing and secondary EBS is additional drive that we attach as extra volume.
it means when we terminate or delete an instance.EBS volume attached to that instance will also be deleted if the attribute is enabled
or else only the instance will be deleted and EBS volume will remain the same and the billing will be applied only for that.
