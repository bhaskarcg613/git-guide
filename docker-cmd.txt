how to build an image in docker?
  to build an image in docker first we need to create a folder for our project.
  with in that folder we need to add our project files for example html,css,javascript file and more.
  then we need to create a docker file inside same folder
  next we need to run a command docker build -t <image-name> . or folder path which includes all you project files and docker file
  now docker image is built and ready.
  to see our docker images --> execute command docker images. it will display all docker images in our local

how to write a docker file?
  docker file will include instructions and values.
  for example:
    FROM nginx:alpine
    COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

  this is a docker file example to show how it looks.
  docker file will not have any extension like txt or word
  we should save it as Dockerfile where D should be capital and no space in between.

  FROM is an instruction which tells docker engine to look for base image nginx with alpine version
  COPY is an instruction which tells docker engine to copy all the files in the existing directory to nginx server directory

How to run a docker image?
  to run a docker image we need to use a command
    docker run <image-name>
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 <image-name> ---> this will create a container and run our image within that and expose our application in 8080 port
    -d --> runs container in detached mode
    -p --> run container in specified port
    8080 --> host port ---> this port defines our entrypoint
    80 --> container port ---> this port is exactly where our application is listening inside a container
    docker engine just routes the request from host port to container port internally
    container port will not be exposed to outside network or internet.

  understanding what is host port and container port with simple example:
    host = server or laptop
    host port = entry point from which request can reach to container. (just think there is user folder in c drive:
                                                                        now c drive will be your entry point or host port
                                                                        and user folder inside that will be a container)
    container = folder which holds our application and its dependensies
    container or application port = inside container our application will be present and running
    so within this we will be having our web server and our application is hosted in this web server.
    it means there is a web server and inside that our application is running ---> the web server port is called container or application port.

    c drive ---> user folder ---> web server(http) --> application
    host port --> container ---> container/application port ---> application

    in general application port is the end point where our application is present or it is the one which connects the request with our application.
    host port is entry point
    application port is end point.

command to check running container ---> docker ps
command to check or list all the existing containers ---> docker ps -a
command to stop container --> docker stop container-name or id
command to start container --> docker start container-name or id
command to restart container --> docker restart container-name or id
command to create a container --> docker run -it -d --name <container-name> -p <port-number> image-name
command to remove/delete container --> docker rmi container-name
command to remove/delete image --> docker rmi image-name
