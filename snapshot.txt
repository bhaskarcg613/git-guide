what is snapshot?

snapshot is nothing but a backup of an EBS volume or device storage. which contains a copy all the data present in a EBS volume.

snapshots are used to transfer EBS from one ec2 instance to another in different AZ within a single region.

snapshots are also used to store data backup.

snapshots can be used across multiple AZ.

if we delete a snapshot then it will be in recycle bin for a certain time period. if needed we can restore from recycle bin.
we can also configure how long can a deleted snapshot should be stored in recycle bin and the duration will be from 1 day to 1 year max.

if snapshots taken were rarely used then we can move them to snapshot archive so the data will be compressed and reduce the cost to store.
to restore data from archive may take time depending upon size of data or EBS volume.

basically data will compressed and stored in archive and once we try to restore it will be coverted from archive to original format so it may take more time.
